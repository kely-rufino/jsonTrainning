Part 1:
Make a fetch request to the json file I shared in Slack.
Console.log the JSON inside it.-OKAY

Part 2:
console.log only people that have pets.
You will have to filter the array (remember to look at the notes from week 2 and use
the MDN docs to figure it out, too).

Part 3:
Display every person in your HTML

Part 4 (stretch):
Make a button that will change your HTML to only show the people with pets
